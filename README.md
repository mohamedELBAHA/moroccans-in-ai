Welcome to Moroccans in AI, a website dedicated to showcasing the profiles of prominent Moroccan researchers in the field of artificial intelligence. The objectives are:
    
1. To connect young Moroccan PhD students in AI with established researchers. We hope this facilitates mentorship opportunities, sparks collaborations, and provides a valuable guidance channel.
2. To showcase top Moroccan researchers globally who are pioneering in cutting-edge AI domains.
3. To inspire and motivate young Moroccan students eager to make their mark in the transformative world of AI.

If you think that someone is missing from our list of featured researchers, we welcome contributions from the community. You can create a pull request on our GitHub repository to suggest the addition of a new researcher or to update the information for an existing one.

We hope that you find our website informative and inspiring, and we invite you to explore the profiles of our featured researchers to learn more about their work.
